# HI I am Bhavya Dhanwani 😊😁

 I have given all my files of jarvis above as you can see ☝☝☝
 you can download all my files in a zip file and after that extract them in a seperate folder 

## After that follow the below steps

 In the file 😁 _**Jarvis.py**_ 😁 all the main code is written
 And in the other files all the seperate code is written and which is used in the program further 😎😎
 you can see the code and can use it to understand if the code shows the error then deffinatly it will be due to change in the cookies of bard or your mic is not connected 

solution of the error connect mic using wo mic client or you can do something else what you know

second is of change in bard cookies to solve it download edit this cookie extension and then click on it and the click on export button and run the code in help named bard.py you will receive three cookies go to jarvis.py and change the cookies copy the three cookies and then copy them and after that change in jarvischat.py

Before using it change **Openai_Api** With your openai api key in jarvis.py and in help there are two codes gptbhaiya.py and gptbhaiya2.py if you need then you can change their also **openai_api** with your api 

open the file **Start.py** and minimize it **speak Wake up jarvis to stat jarvis** And the progam will be launched 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

you can remove the comments from 1527 to 1532 in jarvis.py to run the intro video this is the code of that lines

``` python
sleep(2)
os.startfile("videos\\JARVISintro.mp4")
sleep(27)

click(x=1334, y=20)
pyautogui.click(x=1334,y=20)
```

change clipdrop api with your api in try folder in texttoimage.py
To get it visit tot the [link](https://clipdrop.co/apis) and generate it 

#### Sorry But i am unable to give requirement.txt because my laptop is too old and is unable to create it but you can install package from seeing which packages are imported in jarvis.py 🙏🙏🙏🙏

# All the other information regarding jarvis you will get in the everything about jarvis floder in that there is a requirement.txt to be installed before using jarvis
